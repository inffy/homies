My dotfiles 2.0, managed by chezmoi

I'm redoing all my dotfiles so figured I'd do it a combination of chezmoi and just. 

I've started over so I'm shooting for minimalist at first, let's see how long that lasts, enjoy!

On a new machine:

1. Set up ssh keys first!
1. `chezmoi init castrojo/homies`
1. `chezmoi status`
    
Then `just` to see new machine setup tasks.
