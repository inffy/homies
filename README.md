My dotfiles 2.0, managed by chezmoi

I'm redoing all my dotfiles so figured I'd do it a combination of chezmoi and just. 

I've started over so I'm shooting for minimalist at first, let's see how long that lasts, enjoy!

On a new machine: 

    sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --one-shot castrojo/homies
    
Then `just` to see new machine setup tasks.
